> This command lets a web page run commands on your system. Although this will change in the future, for now it should be considered insecure by default.

> There are two reasons why you would want to run it:
> - You're [writing your own nstaller](https://nstal.dev/). As the author of the web page, you know you are not going to trick yourself.
> - You are involved in the [nstal](https://nstal.dev/) project in a way or another and understand what you're doing.

[nstal](https://nstal.dev/) is a new way to write tutorials and installation procedures.
An nstaller not only describes what should be done, it can also run the steps automatically.

The `nstal` CLI tool is in charge of linking the web page to the local system.
